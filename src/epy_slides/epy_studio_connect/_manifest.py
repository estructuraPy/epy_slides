"""One application's Studio identity, stated from the application side.

The values here are the same ones ``epy_studio``'s ``apps.epyson``
carries for this application -- the same ``id``, the same ``display``,
the same ``register`` mode. The duplication is deliberate and temporary:
until Studio reads this package, the launcher's catalog stays the single
source of the list, and a build can assert the two agree rather than let
them drift. Stating it here is what makes the contract reviewable from
the application's own repository.
