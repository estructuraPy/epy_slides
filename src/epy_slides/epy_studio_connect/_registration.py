"""Registration and launch hint, stated by the application itself.

Studio's installer calls ``--register`` on every application that claims a
document type. An application that authors no document type claims
nothing, and this module says so out loud rather than returning silence:
"register ran and did nothing" and "register never ran" must not look the
same from the installer's log.

Nothing here imports Qt, and nothing here writes the registry: building
the entries is pure string work, so the whole contract is testable without
a display and without touching a real machine.
