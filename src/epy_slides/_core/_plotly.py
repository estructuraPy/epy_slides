"""Plotly fenced-block handling for epy_slides decks.

A ```` ```{.plotly ...} ```` (or ```` ```plotly ````) fenced code block
holding a Plotly figure spec (``{"data": [...], "layout": {...}}``) is
converted into an ``<div class="epy-plotly">`` placeholder plus a sibling
``<script type="application/json">`` payload that the bundled, inlined
Plotly.js engine renders at load time (see ``template._plotly_block``).

Two fence attributes are recognized:

* ``fallback=path/to/image.png`` — a pre-rendered static image used
  whenever the interactive figure cannot be shown (PPTX export, or a PDF
  print that cannot render the figure canvas).
* ``height=420px`` — the CSS height of the figure container (defaults to
  :data:`DEFAULT_HEIGHT`).

Mirrors :mod:`epy_reports._core._plotly`: the embed contract (JSON spec →
``div.epy-plotly`` + ``script[data-plotly-for]`` → ``Plotly.newPlot``) is
frontend-agnostic, so reveal.js decks carry their own copy of it instead of
importing the report frontend (epy_slides depends on neither epy_docs nor
epy_reports).
