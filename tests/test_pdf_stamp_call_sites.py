"""Every call into the shared stamping engine passes what it requires.

`epy_export.add_metadata` takes `creator` and `producer` as required
keywords with NO default: the shared engine refuses to guess which
application produced a document, because a PDF that claims the wrong
producer is worse than one that claims none.

Nothing in THIS repository is currently missing them -- both library
call sites pass both. The guard is here because the sibling that shares
the engine was not so lucky: `epy_reports` shipped a window export that
raised TypeError on every press, and the `except (OSError,
RuntimeError)` around it did not even catch that. Required keywords are
added upstream, in another repository, and a call site that misses one
fails only when that line is REACHED.

Reading the calls rather than running them is the point. A window's
export path needs a rendered deck, a Qt web engine and a real file on
disk, so no test reaches those lines; this check costs milliseconds and
names the file and line.
